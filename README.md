## Convolution Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository contains projects from Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course. The course is a deep-dive into neural networks for image recognition.  Machine learning algorithms were developed in Python using numpy and matplotlib for visualization.

Each subdirectory contains an assignment for the course:
* assignment1 - kNN, SVM, Softmax, two layer network.
* assignment2 - Fully-connected Neural Networks, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Convolution Neural Networks on CIFAR-10 data.
