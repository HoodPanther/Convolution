## Convolution Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository contains projects from the Winter Quarter 2016 offering of Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course. The course is a deep-dive into neural networks for image recognition.  Machine learning algorithms were developed in Python using numpy and matplotlib for visualization.

Each subdirectory contains an assignment for the course:
* assignment1 - KNN, SVM, Softmax and Neural Network classifiers, high-level pixel features.
